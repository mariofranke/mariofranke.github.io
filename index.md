## 13.0.18 Analog Flashcards to Anki Workflow

Android App Simple Scanner -> Resillio Sync -> Python Script -> Anki  
I write Flashcards then make Pictures with my Android Smartphone from the Front and Back with "Simple Scanner".  
It applies Filters to make the Pictures look more like a real Scan then  
Sync the the Pictures with an App called "Resilio Sync" back to my main Maschine.  
Dropbox or another Service should work too.  
Finally an Python script takes the Images and build a .csv file and copies the images to your Anki Libary.   
Finally just import it with Anki into any deck and enjoy Handwritten 2 Side Flashcards.  

## Org Mode Mobile Workflow

On my current Workflow i use Resillio-Sync to sync my .org files between my 2 Mac and my Android Smartphone.
The Smartphone is read-only because i have never succesfully managed to get Orglzy and Resillio-Sync running without Sync Conflicts. I use Orgzly to view my Tasks and an Automate Scripty to send new Tasks to an Email adress and fetchmail on the mac to get them into my main org file. It allows me to never worry about Conflicts and got no problems so far.
